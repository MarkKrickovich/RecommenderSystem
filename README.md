### Collaborative Filtering: User-Based & Item-Based
#### User-Based Collaborative Filtering: 
This type of recommender system leverages the behavior and interests of other people (in this case, other movie veiwers) to inform what you might enjoy. This entails finding other viewers like me and recommending movies they liked.  This solution makes recommendations based on other people's collaborative behavior.
