# Recommender System with Supriselib


### Film Recommender System
This project includes code and insight from a 2018 LinkedIn Learning Course titled "Building Recommender Systems with Machine Learning and AI".  The code example provided represents a user-based and an item-based collaborative filtering.  
#### User-Based Collaborative Filtering: 
This type of recommender system leverages the behavior and interests of other people (in this case, other movie veiwers) to inform what you might enjoy. This entails finding other viewers like me and recommending movies they liked.  This solution makes recommendations based on other people's collaborative behavior.
